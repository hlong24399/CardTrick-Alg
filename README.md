This is the CardTrick project:
This project will create a deck of 21 cards and shuffle it, then you will be told to pick one card and save it in your mind. Then, it will
deal the deck into 3 columns and let you choose which column that has your card. This process repeats three times and it will print out
the card that you choose.
